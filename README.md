# Collatz-Conjecture

This program takes input from the user (positive integers) and returns collatz(n). 

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: 
- Start with any positive integer n. 
- Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
- The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
